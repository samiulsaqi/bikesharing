# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

This analysis is done on the August 2019 data from Citibike, a company operating in the city of New York, to find out about different trends that may impact a similar business that wants to open up a bike sharing business. The data available is analyzed from different angle based on hours of operation, gender, time duration, location etc to provide a better understanding of the trends. Tableau was used to analyze the trends. The visualization can be found at the below link:

## Results:

The main visualizations created are as follows:

1. Checkout Times for Users: This shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. The initial bike trip is always the longest, as people need to figure and test out the bike workings.

## Summary:

Overall, given the data, it seems male customers are more used to riding during the weekdays and weekends, and the popular time seems to be the office starting(8-9) and ending hours(5-6) as this seems to be a popular mode of transport.
